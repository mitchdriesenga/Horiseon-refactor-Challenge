# Horiseon Refactor Challenge

Re working existing code for a website to enhance the websites acessibility and SEO, as well as consolidate CSS selectors and properties. 

## Description

The task I was given was to re-work existing html and css files for Horiseon's wbesite to enhance the accessibility and SEO of the website, as well as consilidating the css file to get rid of extra code and clean up the stylesheet. 

-HTML fixes 

To clean these up I replaced div elements with semantic HTML elements, to make the website more sequential to a browser. I used header, footer, and section elements as replacements for divs. I also labeled the code using comments to make it easier to read for future developers, such as labeling when the "Hero" or "Content" sections began. To make improvements with the accessibility, I added descriptive alt attributes to image elements so that a screen reader will be able to describe the webpage more accuratley. A more apporpriate name in the title name was also added to show the name of the website in the tab when the website is viewed. The nav elements were also fixed to their corresponding sections using id attributes so the page would jump to that when the titles of the section were clicked in the webpage header.

-CSS Fixes

Many of the CSS selectors contained many of the same property and property values in the style sheet, which just made for too many codelines that were necessary. I consolidated them into "content" sections and "Benefits" sections, and then renamed the class attributes in the correct HTML elements so the webpage would still function the same way. Comments were also added to the CSS file to make the code easier to read and navigate.
